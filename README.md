### Interview: Insights Gained from Self-Questioning

- **Current method of schedule management**
  - Managing schedules using a calendar app and utilizing alarm notifications.

- **Challenges and Points of Dissatisfaction**
  - The current calendar app does not make the relationship between goals and corresponding tasks clear.
  - When breaking down goals into daily tasks, the relation between them gets lost.
  - Difficulty in managing long-term goals

- **Necessary Features and Requirements**
  - Ability to break down large goals and visualize their relations.
  - A bird’s eye view of long-term schedules and understanding the progression of time and days towards achieving the goal.
  - Scheduling tasks for a goal

### Pain Points
1. The relationship between goals and tasks is unclear, making effective goal achievement difficult.
2. Long-term goal management and daily task management are disjointed, making it hard to have an overview.
3. Current calendar apps do not allow for breaking down goals, making the path to achieving them unclear.
4. Task prioritization and progress tracking are cumbersome, making efficient task management difficult.
5. There is a risk of missing important tasks or schedules as the notification feature is inadequate.
6. Lack of flexibility in schedules makes adjustments and changes difficult.
7. Time and progress towards goal achievement are not clear, making it hard to maintain motivation.

### User Stories
1. Want to clearly understand the relationship between long-term goals, related tasks, and TODOs, to maintain focus and motivation.
2. Want a comprehensive schedule view that includes short-term and long-term goals to effectively plan and prioritize tasks.
3. Want to break down long-term goals into smaller milestones and tasks and reflect them in daily schedules for effective progress tracking.
4. Want to receive notifications and reminders related to goals and tasks for organized task management and deadline adherence.
5. Want a user-friendly interface that allows easy navigation across different levels of goals and tasks. A visual display of overall progress and timeline helps in having a clear understanding and maintaining motivation.

### User Journey Map: Experience of Using the Schedule Management App
Based on the experience of a user named X who values scheduling.

1. **Goal Setting and Calendar View Overview**
   - X logs into the schedule management app and sets their long-term goals.
   - X opens the app’s calendar view to get an overview of the entire goal landscape.
   - Goals are broadly represented in the calendar view, with related sub-goals and tasks being collapsible.

2. **Goal Breakdown and Task Setting**
   - X breaks down long-term goals into specific tasks and milestones.
   - Using the app’s goal management feature, X sets tasks and deadlines related to each goal.
   - Goals and tasks are reflected in the calendar view while maintaining their relation.

3. **Daily Task Management and Progress Tracking**
   - X adds daily tasks and schedules into the app’s task list.
   - Tasks are linked to goals and sub-goals and are reflected in the calendar view.
   - X inputs the progress and visualizes the advancement towards goal achievement.

4. **Receiving Notifications and Reminders**
   - The app sends notifications and reminders related to goal deadlines and important tasks.
   - X receives the notifications and adjusts task priorities and schedules for deadline adherence.

5. **Progress Check and Review**
   - X regularly checks the app’s progress dashboard to review goal achievement and progress status.
   - X gains satisfaction from completed tasks and goals and moves on to the next steps or challenges.

### Problem Statement
X is facing challenges in effective goal achievement and task management due to unclear relations and overview in their current schedule management method. X seeks to use the schedule management app to clearly understand the relations between goals and tasks and to track progress.

### Hypothesis Statement
By enabling users to clearly understand the relationship between long-term goals and tasks in the schedule management app, it is predicted that effective goal achievement and task management will improve, thereby increasing user productivity.

### Design Problem Statements

1. Even when using a schedule management app, users struggle to clearly understand the relationship between goals and tasks, making effective goal achievement and task management difficult.
2. Existing schedule management apps keep long-term goal management and daily task management disjointed, making it hard to have an overview.
3. The notification feature in existing schedule management apps is inadequate, posing a risk for users to miss important tasks or schedules.
4. Users find task prioritization and progress tracking to be complex and cumbersome, even when using a schedule management app.

### Value Proposition

This schedule management app provides a unique feature that allows users to clearly understand the relationship between long-term goals and tasks, thus supporting effective goal achievement and task management. The following features aim to improve user productivity:

1. **Goal Granulation and Task Relation Display:**
   - Allows the segmentation of long-term goals into gradual steps and clearly displays related tasks.
   - Users can break down large goals into smaller tasks and monitor real-time progress towards goal achievement.

2. **Integrated Calendar View:**
   - The calendar view incorporates goals and tasks (performance-dependent).
   - Users can easily manage their long-term schedule and daily tasks at a glance.

3. **Reminder and Notification Feature:**
   - Provides reminders and notifications for important tasks and schedules.
   - Users can keep track of easily overlooked schedules and deadlines without forgetting them.
